# MakerPnP

Cross-platform Pick-and-Place machine software, for Makers!

## Project Introduction

[![MakerPnP - Project Introduction](http://img.youtube.com/vi/s9yh92Ctqh8/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9yh92Ctqh8 "MakerPnP Project Introduction")

This project is work-in-progress, you can follow development using the links in the [links](#links) section below. 

## Project Status

Development is currently focussed on the workflow side of PCB assembly. Currently, a pure-rust desktop GUI for the
planner is being developed and is in a usable state.  Additionally, there are currently two functional cli tools,
planner_cli and variant builder.

Machine operations has not been started yet, it will be started when the process/workflow concepts and tooling matures.

## Planning

A PCB assembly job generally consists of the following things:

1) One or more PCBs that need populating, which may need populated on a single side or both sides.
2) A list of placements for each EDA design variant to be populated. 
3) A list of manufacturer + part codes for each part used in the job. (aka Bill-of-materials/BOM)
4) One or more processes.
4) A set of operations for each process.
5) A set of tasks for each operation.
6) One or more phases.
7) A set of parts for each phase.
8) One or more load-outs.
9) A defined placement ordering for each phase.

For example, a manual placement job for a double-sided 2x2 panel of PCBs with 2 designs, each design having 2 assembly
variants might be defined as follows:

```

        ├── Ordering: Panel Unit:Ascending, Part Cost:Ascending, Part Area:Ascending, Quantity:Desc
        └── Loadout: 'desk-bottom'.
```

Similarly, the job for a single-sided 4x1 panel having a single design variant, using a mixed assembly
processes (SMT + TH) might be defined as follows:

```

## PlannerGUI

The planner GUI is used to define and manage the PCB assembly process, it works for automated, manual and mixed process
assembly jobs.

It's primary function is to allow you to define the assembly job and manage the job progress. It also generates artifacts
required for each process (e.g. a load-out and placement files).

Here's a recent screenshot:

[<img src="assets/screenshots/plannergui/planner_gui_2025-04-22_132254.png" width="800" alt="PlannerGUI">](assets/screenshots/plannergui/planner_gui_2025-04-22_132254.png)

## PlannerCLI

The PlannerCLI has the same functionality as the PlannerGUI, but with a command line interface.

Here's the current help output:

```
$ ./target/debug/planner_cli.exe --help

  -h, --help                    Print help
  -V, --version                 Print version
```

## VariantBuilderCLI

The variant builder CLI is used to take output files from EDA tools (e.g. DipTrace, KiCad, EasyEDAPro) and build
normalized placement files for the Planner.  Normalizing consists of these main tasks:

1) Cross-referencing EDA tool BOM information with your part inventory, using rules.
2) Substituting parts, using rules.
3) Selecting suitable parts from potential candidates, using load-out and rules. 
4) Normalizing units and co-ordinate systems.

It's common in small-volume manufacturing to have just a single PnP machine with feeder load-out that you don't want
to change.  The Variant Builder can prefer to use parts that are already in the machine so that you have to change
as few feeders as possible.  This is particularly useful for users of machines with drag-pin feeders, such as the
CharmHigh CHMT32VA/CHMT32VB/CHMT48VA/CHMT48VB machines, where the feeders are not individually replaceable.  The 
variant builder software is sensitive to the knowledge that changing feeders and machine-setup can be a very
time-consuming process. 

Here's the current help output:

```
$ ./target/debug/variantbuilder_cli.exe build --help

          Print help
```

## Gerber Viewer

There's a stand-alone gerber viewer, it can render gerber files generated with DipTrace 4.3, KiCad 8.0, and other tools.

Here's a screenshot:

[<img src="assets/screenshots/gerber_viewer/gerber_viewer_2025-05-01_221636.png" width="800" alt="GerberViewer">](assets/screenshots/gerber_viewer/gerber_viewer_2025-05-01_221636.png)

The above list is likely sufficient for viewing most modern PCB gerber files, the macro support is a key feature.

The list of supported features will be improved as developer time permits, if you'd like to contribute, please see the
![contributing](#contributing) section below.

### Feedback 

If you have gerber files and have rendering issues, please create an issue with screenshots and a gerber file.  If
you're able to create a gerber file with just the elements that have issues that would be preferred.


## Getting started

Currently, you have to build from source, but WAIT! it's EASY!

1) install rust (use [Rustup](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install))
2) clone the repo (use git via `git clone https://github.com/MakerPnP/makerpnp.git`, or [download a zip file from github](https://github.com/MakerPnP/makerpnp/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)) and extract it.
3) run the following commands in your terminal:
```
cd makerpnp
cargo build --release
```

After it's built there's executable files in the `target/release` directory:

```
$ ls -g target/release/*.exe
-rwxr-xr-x 2 None 13341184 Apr 28 14:06 target/release/gerber_viewer_egui.exe
-rwxr-xr-x 2 None  5775872 Apr 28 14:06 target/release/planner_cli.exe
-rwxr-xr-x 2 None 22119936 Apr 28 14:06 target/release/planner_gui_egui.exe
-rwxr-xr-x 2 None  3703296 Apr 28 14:06 target/release/variantbuilder_cli.exe
```

## Running the tools

The CLI tools can be run from anywhere, they are self-contained.
The GUI tools need to be run from the corresponding source directory as they require assets.  e.g.

```
cd crates/planner_gui_egui
../../target/release/planner_gui_egui.exe
```

## Architecture

The current architecture is to use Crux to provide rust-based back-ends (cores), and then to write Crux
'shells', also in rust, to provide front-ends (GUI/CLI) or APIs (e.g. web/rpc/etc) which use the common cores.  This
does add a layer of complexity, but should future-proof the project somewhat and also allows creation of non-rust
native apps that use the rust core.  Check out the 'Crux' documentation.

Given the state of Rust GUI frameworks, and that a 3 month-long investigation was done and documented in the form of a 
40+ livestream series. Using Crux gives the project a way of being able to change the GUI library for a different one
if the chosen GUI library, egui, does not meet future requirements.  This approach turned out to be very useful when
the Cushy GUI framework was replaced with egui.

See:
* Comparison of GUI libraries - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cxH_GgzrGDpXm4CN0cWvQ9RF_PLf6HEvVYcZhqOO0nc/edit?usp=sharing
* 'Trying Rust GUI tech in 2024' video series playlist - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUCLWCDEWm8g7pHKQGE7Pokk4wiVU8rLl 

In the end, [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui) was chosen for the GUI framework due to it's large community and
ability to create usable productivity-style GUIs.

Currently, it's thought that the software wil have these main components:
* Machine control - for co-ordination of hardware control through one or more drivers (gcode, cameras, vision).
* Machine operator UI - for machine configuration, job setup, and job operations.  feeders, cameras, head/nozzle/tool
  control, integrates with the machine control and planner components.  
* Planner UI - used to manage assembly projects, can be used without a pick-and-place machine, can generate artifacts
  usable by the operator UI (jobs), with EDA support (KiCad, Diptrace, EasyEda, etc.).

If you're familiar with 3D printing, you can think of the Planner as the 'slicer', the operator UI as the 3D printer's
front panel (touchscreen/buttons/display), and Machine control is a bit like the firmware, but not, since the machine
control component will interact with one or more drivers which will communicate to one or more pieces of hardware, each
with their own firmware, where as 3d printers usually only have one main control-board with a single piece of firmware. 

Examples of hardware which *could* be interacted with include:
* dedicated pink-and-place boards, usually via gcode (for x/y/z, vacuum, nozzle control, feeder actuators)
* 3d printer control boards, usually via gcode (again for x/y/z, vacuum, nozzle control, feeder actuators)
* feeder actuator systems (e.g. via RS485/RS232 + arbitrary protocol)
* conveyor/stacker systems (for loading pcbs into a machine)
* local or ip cameras
* and anything else you can dream of.

## Documentation

Written documentation for the project is sparse, further documentation will be created in due course.  However, the 
design and operation of the tools is detailed in the livestreams.

There are also functional tests which detail the expected input/output and operation sequences, so you can refer to
those to gain additional understanding.  See `crates/planner_cli/tests/planner.rs` and
`crates/variantbuilder/tests/variantbuider.rs`.
